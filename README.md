## Warbler

Warbler is the final project of the 'Advanced Web Development Bootcamp' course on Udemy.

Please note that functionality and style of this app are very basic since the main point of this project was to learn how to create full-stack apps with React, Redux, React Router, etc.

The code contains many unstructured comments which are for the learning purposes and are to be removed.

The client part was bundled using Create React App package.
